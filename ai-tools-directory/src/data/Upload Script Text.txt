Let me create a new script that can handle multiple JSON files. This script will:

Allow you to specify multiple JSON files
Process them in sequence
Keep track of overall progress
Generate a summary report

==================================================

python mongodb_upload_multi.py --confirm

python mongodb_upload_multi.py file1.json file2.json file3.json --confirm

================================================


The script includes these improvements:

Processes multiple files in sequence
Provides per-file progress and summary
Maintains a single backup of the database
Tracks overall statistics (total tools added, skipped, etc.)
Handles errors gracefully and continues processing other files
Shows which files failed to process, if any
You can now:

Place all your JSON files in the AirTable/Converted directory
Run the script once to process all files
Get a complete summary of what was added/skipped
Would you like me to:

Run the script with the current file?
Wait for you to add more JSON files?
Modify the script in any way?
